# Zero-Trust-Project-develop
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the Zero Trust security model. Built with Flask and using a MongoDB database, it allows users to log in and view their profile with principles aligned to Zero Trust — meaning no implicit trust is given to users or devices, even if they’re inside the network perimeter.
